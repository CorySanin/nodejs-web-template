# Node Web Template

nodejs web project template. Has barebones express-session integration that can either be improved if session management is necessary or removed otherwise.

## Setup

install dependencies with `npm install`. Make the project with `npm run build`. Start with `npm run start`.

## Assets

Preparing assets for prod is handled via [forking-build-shit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forking-build-shit). Source files should be stored as follows:

- (S)CSS files in `styles/`
- Frontend JS in `scripts/`
- Images in `assets/images/original/`
